# Hand_Pose_Detection

I wrote this script to detect the hand poses in realtime. This script use OpenCV to get the feed from the webcam, then analyzed the poses by overlaying mediapipe detection  model and rendered the images to OpenCV. This is the initial scrip for many further applications that can be developed to detect sign language, fingure counting or thumps up/down signals.
